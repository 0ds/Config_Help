Redirection:-                                   +                           FileDescripter
 File 	                File Descriptor
Standard Input STDIN 	0
Standard Output STDOUT 	1
Standard Error STDERR 	2

Examples:-
1.    $ myprogram 2>errorsfile  ---------> error output
2.    # find . -name 'my*' 2>error.log  ----------------> This cmd looks for all files starting with "my" and if it has denied permissions to access the errot log will get redirected to this log file.
3.  Server Administrators frequently, list directories and store both error and standard output into a file, which can be processed later. Here is the command.
      # ls Documents ABC> dirlist 2>&1
      
 Summary

1    Each file in Linux has a corresponding File Descriptor associated with it
2   The keyboard is the standard input device while your screen is the standard output device
3    ">" is the output redirection operator. ">>" appends output to an existing file
4    "<" is the input redirection operator
5    ">&"re-directs output of one file to another.
6    You can re-direct error using its corresponding File Descriptor 2.

++++++FileDescripter++++++++
In simple words, when you open a file,the operating system creates an entry to represent that file and store the information 
about that opened file. So if there are 100 files opened in your OS then there will be 100 entries in OS (somewhere in kernel). 
These entries are represented by integers like (...100, 101, 102....). 
This entry number is the file descriptor. So it is just an integer number that uniquely represents an opened file in operating 
system. If your process opens 10 files then your Process table will have 10 entries for file descriptors.
